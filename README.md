# Speech-Recognition-using-CNN

- Adaptation from a paper by Abdel-Hamid et al. (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/CNN_ASLPTrans2-14.pdf)
- Dataset taken from Kaggle - Medical Speech Transcriptions (https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/medical-speech-transcription-and-intent)

Libraries:
- Librosa used for audio processing
- Keras for model building

Note:
This is just a proof of concept. The model has been trained on a very small subset of the original data. Also, due to the resource limitation on Colab, only 10 feature maps used instead of 150.
